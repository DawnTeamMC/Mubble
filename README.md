*Expand your world with features from the Nintendo universe, and way more.*

Mubble is a very complete mod that adds many useful blocks, items and costumes that feel very natural to Minecraft vanilla.

This mod also offers many new ways to players to build and experience the world of Minecraft with their favorite Nintendo franchises. With that in their hands, players are capable of building up the biggest cross-over world of their dreams! In creative through the tabs or in survival through recipes, everything is easily found and they work as you think they should!

We are very open to community requests. The journey won't be done soon, as we will be updating Mubble for a very long time, featuring more and more franchises as well as unique features!

Mubble is available in English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese and more!
