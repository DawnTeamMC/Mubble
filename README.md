## Presentation
**Mubble** is a mod for **Forge** and **Fabric** that aims at creating new content that would fit pretty well with the vanilla environment. It also adds an astronomic amount of content coming from other video games.

With over 1000 features, **Mubble** adds new decorative blocks, items, costumes, biomes, and way more! A large portion of the mod also focuses on Nintendo content, and also features indie games. We are very open to community requests. The journey won't be done soon, as we will be updating Mubble for a very long time, featuring more and more franchises as well as unique features!

Mubble is available in English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Chinese and Brazilian Portuguese.
